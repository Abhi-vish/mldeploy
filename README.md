# Admission Prediction

This is an admission prediction feature based on a linear model trained on a dataset containing 400 records. This model aims to predict the likelihood of admission to a university based on various factors.
## Dataset

The training dataset, named "admission_predict.csv," is a collection of records that includes the following features:

- GRE Score: The score obtained in the Graduate Record Examination.

- TOEFL Score: The score obtained in the Test of English as a Foreign Language.

- University Rating: The rating of the university attended by the applicant (on a scale of 1 to 5).

- Statement of Purpose (SOP): The quality of the applicant's statement of purpose (on a scale of 1 to 5).

- Letter of Recommendation (LOR): The strength of the applicant's letter of recommendation (on a scale of 1 to 5). 

- CGPA: The Cumulative Grade Point Average achieved by the applicant.

- Research: Whether or not the applicant has research experience (0 for no, 1 for yes).

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned several key concepts and faced various challenges. Here are the details:

- I learned about Linear Regression and its application in predicting outcomes based on continuous variables.
- I gained knowledge about feature selection techniques, including methods to identify and handle collinearity and multicollinearity in the dataset.
- I became familiar with preprocessing techniques such as standard scaling, which helps in normalizing the features to ensure fair comparisons.
- I also learned about the variance influence factor and its significance in understanding the impact of individual data points on the overall model.
- Throughout the project, I worked with different libraries and tools to handle and preprocess the data effectively, ensuring its suitability for the machine learning algorithms.
